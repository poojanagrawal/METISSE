# Using METISSE to evolve single stars

 
METISSE can be used directly (in what we call its standalone mode) to compute the evolution of one star or a population of single stars.

In order to run METISSE, we first need to compile it. 
*makefile* in folder *make* contains all necessary instructions to compile METISSE in standalone mode. 

To compile the package open a command line shell and inside the METISSE folder execute:

```console

$ ./mk

```

You will now see an executable named `metisse` which was not there before. 

:::{Note}

The code does not need to be re-compiled unless you make changes inside the source `src` directory.

## Evolving one star 

Let us compute the evolution of a star with initial mass 1 M<sub>$_\odot$</sub> star, metallicity `Z = 0.02` upto the age of 12 Gyr. 
Input to METISSE in the standalone mode is provided through two Fortran namelists: `SSE_input_controls` and `METISSE_input_controls`. 
See sections [](input_files.md#sse-input-controls) and [](input_files.md#metisse-input-controls) for a complete list of input options. 


`SSE_input_controls` is contained in the file called `main.input` and
is used to provide evolution details of the star.
 
```
&SSE_input_controls

initial_Z = 0.02

max_age = 1.2d4   

number_of_tracks = 1
min_mass = 1.d0

write_track_to_file = .true.   
/

```

We also need to provide the details of the input tracks to METISSE through the namelist `METISSE_input_controls`. 
In the standalone mode of METISSE, `METISSE_input_controls` is contained in the file called `metisse.input`. 


We use the variable `tracks_dir` for normal hydrogen stars and the variable`tracks_dir_he` for naked helium/stripped stars to supply paths to the folders that contain files ending with *_metallicity.in*. 
For the pre-packaged grid of stellar tracks available with METISSE, this is the path of the `hydrogen` and `helium` folders respectively.


```
&METISSE_input_controls


tracks_dir = '/Users/poojan/stellar_tracks/MESA/big_z/hydrogen'
            
tracks_dir_he = '/Users/poojan/stellar_tracks/MESA/big_z/helium'

verbose = .true.

/

```
Note that we have also set `verbose` to true so that we can see details of the input tracks on the screen. 
If verbose is False, then these details are written `tracks.log.txt` file. 


To run METISSE simply type `./metisse` on the command line and hit enter. METISSE will produce the following output on the screen:

``` console

     Time    12000.0    Phase        FGB     Mass   0.999
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Reached end of the program

```

Since we had set, `write_track_to_file = .true.` in `SSE_input_controls`, a [SSE-style](./acronyms_definitions.md#output-files) output file will also be generated in the *output* directory, containing a more detailed output.


## Evolving a stellar population

To compute the evolution of a single stellar population containing, for example, 10,000 stars with initial masses uniformly distributed between 1 and 100 M<sub>$_\odot$</sub>, we modify the `SSE_input_controls` from the single star case as shown below. 


```
&SSE_input_controls

initial_Z = 0.02

max_age = 1.2d4   

number_of_tracks = 1d+4
min_mass = 1.d0

max_mass = 100.d0

write_track_to_file = .true.   
/

```

We also set `verbose = .false.` in  `metisse.input` to avoid flooding our screen with evolution details of 10,000 stars. 

Running METISSE does not produces any on-screen output this time. 

``` console

$ ./metisse

```

We also kept `write_track_to_file = .true.` in `SSE_input_controls`. Therefore, the `output` directory will now contain the evolutionary histories of all 10,000 stars. 


To compute a population of single stars with any other distribution of initial masses, we can list initial masses in a file and provide the location of that file through `input_mass_file`. If the masses are listed in a file called `my_custom_distribution.txt`, then `SSE_input_controls` will look like this:


```
&SSE_input_controls

initial_Z = 0.02

max_age = 1.2d4   

number_of_tracks = 1d+4

read_mass_from_file = .true.  

input_mass_file = 'my_custom_distribution.txt'

write_track_to_file = .true.  

/

```

Note that we still need to define `number_of_tracks` as METISSE will read `input_mass_file` for that many stars and will raise errors if the file contains fewer stars.  

## If the metallicity value is not present in the input grid


Let's say in the above example of a single star, we set `initial_Z = 0.016`. Running METISSE now gives an error.

``` console
$ ./metisse 
 Input Z is :  0.016000
 Reading naked helium star tracks
 METISSE error: metallicity value =   1.6000000000000000E-002 not found amongst given Z_files
 Check metallicity_file_list and value of Z_files for each file
 If needed, Z_accuracy_limit can be relaxed (set to a greater value).
 Switching to SSE formulae for helium stars 
 Reading main (hydrogen star) tracks
 METISSE error: metallicity value =   1.6000000000000000E-002 not found amongst given Z_files
 Check metallicity_file_list and value of Z_files for each file
 If needed, Z_accuracy_limit can be relaxed (set to a greater value).
STOP Fatal error: terminating METISSE

````

METISSE does not interpolate in metallicity. So ideally, we should compute input tracks with Z = 0.016 and supply them to METISSE. 

Another option is that we can ask METISSE to use nearby metallicity values. 
This is achieved by the variable `Z_accuracy_limit` in `METISSE_input_controls`. Be default it is set to `1d-2`. We increase it to `8d-2`. 

``` console
$ ./metisse

```

METISSE now runs using the closest metallicity value it can find. In this case, it is `0.01`.
