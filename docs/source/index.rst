Welcome to METISSE's documentation!
===================================

**METISSE** is an acronym for **MET**\ hod of **I**\ nterpolation for **S**\ ingle **S**\ tar **E**\ volution. It is a code package designed for rapidly computing the evolution of stellar populations by interpolating within a set of pre-computed evolutionary tracks. The input stellar tracks can be computed from a variety of stellar structure and evolution codes.
 
It can be used as a `standalone code <usage_standalone.html>`_ for evolving populations of single stars or in conjunction with `binary population synthesis codes <usage_other.html>`_ for evolving populations of single and binary stars. 
Check out the following sections for more information about METISSE and how to use it.
